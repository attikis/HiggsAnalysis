TODO list (with priorities)

(high, Ritva working): add filling of variables to CaloTau
(high): add jet energy corrections to CaloTau
(high): add filling of variables to TCTau (should be almost the same
as for the CaloTaus)
(high): add event selection methods (to be applied prior to filling
root-tree)
  - (high) trigger
  - (high) global veto of isolated electrons
  - (high) global veto of isolated muons
  - (medium) tauID (for tau veto)

(medium): TCTau not working with energy corrections at the moment,
Sami will tell when code is ready
(medium): add setting of key variables to the python file (track
quality cuts and cone sizes, if fixed)
(medium): reimplement eventcounter functionality from HipProofAnalysis

(low/medium): add missing variables for PFtaus
(low): add MC matching (reimplement from HipProofAnalysis)
(low): produce all tau collection root files in one submit (see TTeff
for example)
(low): remove the unnecessary python files from the tool for combining root files produced with CRAB 

Existing and tested:
====================
- crab.cfg added enable large scale testing/running; added also tool for combining the resulting root files
- reading the output root trees with AnalysisPack has been succesfully tested 
- code is compiling and running with CMSSW_3_5_4 without any extra tags
- filling of most of 1-prong PFtaus variables exist in code and work
- merging of root trees works with mergeHistograms (from the
HipProofAnalysis package)

The big picture of things to implement:
  done 1) HLT trigger (Lauri)
  2) Global electron veto
  done 3) Global muon veto (Lauri)
  4) tau-jet ID (Alexandros & Ritva)
  5) jet selection
  6) missing ET
  7) b-tagging
  8) top/W reco

For doing jet->tau fake rate studies, we need the points
1,2,3,5, and 6 + the tau-jet dumper. Hence I would consider these high priority.
For doing full signal selection studies we need the whole list (maybe putting 8 as a low priority). 


TODO list (with priorities)
===========================
(high, Ritva working): add filling of variables to CaloTau
(high): add jet energy corrections to CaloTau
(high): add filling of variables to TCTau (should be almost the same
as for the CaloTaus)

(medium): TCTau not working with energy corrections at the moment,
Sami will tell when code is ready
(medium): add setting of key variables to the python file (track
quality cuts and cone sizes, if fixed)

(low/medium): add missing variables for PFtaus
(low): add MC matching (reimplement from HipProofAnalysis)
(low): produce all tau collection root files in one submit (see TTeff
for example)
(low): remove the unnecessary python files from the tool for combining root files produced with CRAB 

Existing and tested:
====================
- crab.cfg added enable large scale testing/running; added also tool for combining the resulting root files
- reading the output root trees with AnalysisPack has been succesfully tested 
- code is compiling and running with CMSSW_3_5_4 without any extra tags
- filling of most of 1-prong PFtaus variables exist in code and work
- merging of root trees works with mergeHistograms (from the
HipProofAnalysis package)
- reimplemented eventcounter functionality from HipProofAnalysis

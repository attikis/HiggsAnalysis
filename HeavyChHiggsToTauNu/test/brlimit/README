To run the analysis in lxplus, in afs-visible area (not tmp directory):
========================================================================

These instructions describe how to run the "shapes" version with LandS.

0) Requirements:
--------------------

The following files are needed to a separate working directory with a unique name, 
replace "*" by the mass points 80/100/120/140/150/155/160:

-lands_datacard_hplushadronic_m*.txt (LandS datacard files)
-lands_histograms_hplushadronic_m*.txt    (LandS shapes histograms)

The working directory should have a unique name to make possible
running several analysis jobs simultaneously.  The name of the
directory is used as the name of the LSF job, and a new job cannot be
started if a job with the same name is still running. 


1) Setup:
----------

In addition to the files mentioned in 0), copy the running files to the working 
directory:

 cp ??/brlimit/mkBrLimits* .


2) Optional: set number of MC toys:
-----------------------------------------

By default, 500 toy MC runs are performed.  This takes about 4 hours
(future plan is to split the jobs in a couple of parallel jobs).  You
can change the number of toys in the file mkBrLimits_runExp .

The integrated luminosity is now read from the datacards.


3) Running
-------------

Just type the following command to launch the jobs:

 ./mkBrLimits

Jobs are submitted LSF, and as a result, the following limit plots are
generated:

 -brlimits.png,          limit plot (mH,Br)
 -mssmLimits_mh.png,     limit plot (mH,tanB)
 -mssmLimits_mus_mh.png, limit plot (mH,tanB) with various mu values 

Also the corresponding eps files are generated.

In "mkBrLimits_mssmLimit.py", you may want to toggle the setting
"useMA" to show results in mA,tanb space, or the setting "showTeva"
and "showLEP" to show/hide Tevatron and LEP results.

Tip: if you have already run the jobs, and want to simpley regenerate plots 
(change plotting style or some other reason), you can do this quickly with 
the following command, which reads the output files from the directory 
"outputs" and producess the plots:

 ./mkBrLimits_process 


Possible problems:
===================

* no output files: 
  -check that you are in lxplus, and your working area can be 
   accessed by afs (for instance scratch directory). 
   DO NOT use a /tmp/ directory since it cannot be accessed by LSF jobs.

# Section in common for all dataset
# General idea: you define all the parameter in the template (crab.cfg), 
# but you might want to change the template values for all dataset.
# The general syntax is that you first put the crab.cfg [SECTION] and
# the the crab.cfg [key], with a "." in between, exactly as you would do
# to pass to CRAB keys via command line.
# Any parameters can be set or changed
[COMMON]

# For JetMETTau + HLT_SingleLooseIsoTau20:
# 10 lumisections  => 0 events
# 100 lumisections => ~14k events, 10 min => 965 events out, ~70 MB
# 1000 lumisections => ~383k events, 5 h 15 min =>  24791 events out, 1.7 GB

CMSSW.total_number_of_lumis = -1

# Add a section for each dataset you want to access (or, more precisely,
# any task you want to create).
# The name of the section will be used as USER.ui_working_dir, so the
# stuff for this dataset will be found in Wmunu/ directory.
# Any name is allowed (but MULTICRAB and COMMON) and any number of
# sections can be added
# The syntax for the parameters is the one described before
# SECTION.key=value
# and any parameter can be changed. Otherwise, the template one will be
# used.

# HPlus instructions:
#
# In order to select a dataset, uncomment the whole section including
# the header ("[...]"). In addition to the header, each dataset should
# have at least 3 other rows:
#   - CMSSW.datasetpath   (which dataset process)
#   - CMSSW.pycfg_params  (parameters to python configuration, in our
#                          case the version of the data for e.g. trigger)
#   - USER.publish_data_name  (dataset name for publication)
#
# In addition depending on the dataset it might be useful to
# white/blaclist sites (e.g. to prefer T2_FI_HIP or European sites
# over American sites to avoid transfers over Atlantic). The defaults
# are the ones used for the production of the previous pattuple
# version. This means that
#  a) when running a new prudction, check them again (at least when
#     something doesn't work!)
#  b) update this file if there are changes
#
# In order to deselect a dataset, comment the whole section.
#
# It is important that none of the lines begin with whitespace!

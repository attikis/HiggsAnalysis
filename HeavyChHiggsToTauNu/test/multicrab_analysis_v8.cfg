# Section in common for all dataset
# General idea: you define all the parameter in the template (crab.cfg), 
# but you might want to change the template values for all dataset.
# The general syntax is that you first put the crab.cfg [SECTION] and
# the the crab.cfg [key], with a "." in between, exactly as you would do
# to pass to CRAB keys via command line.
# Any parameters can be set or changed
[COMMON]

# Add a section for each dataset you want to access (or, more precisely,
# any task you want to create).
# The name of the section will be used as USER.ui_working_dir, so the
# stuff for this dataset will be found in Wmunu/ directory.
# Any name is allowed (but MULTICRAB and COMMON) and any number of
# sections can be added
# The syntax for the parameters is the one described before
# SECTION.key=value
# and any parameter can be changed. Otherwise, the template one will be
# used.

# Use ; to separate the pycfg_params as multicrab doesn't seem to
# support multiple arguments for now. The ; is parsed in the python
# configuration

# In order to select a dataset, uncomment the whole section including
# the header ("[...]"). In addition to the header, each dataset should
# have 2 other rows:
#   - CMSSW.datasetpath   (which dataset process)
#   - CMSSW.pycfg_params  (parameters to python configuration, in our
#                          case the version of the data for e.g. trigger
#                          and MC dataset cross section)
#
# For each dataset, the "CMSSW.datasetpath" line in comments is the
# dataset where the pattuple was produced from.
#
# In order to deselect a dataset, comment the whole section.
#
# It is important that none of the lines begin with whitespace!

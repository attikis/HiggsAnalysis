#TODO: rename them with a name including the current date and time and move them
#into a subdirectory called "old_plots" or similar

# Copy new plots into public folder
cp ./*.png ~strichte/public/html/plots/

# Write update information to log file
#TODO: optional message that can be put into log
#Otherwise just write basic information (time of update)
